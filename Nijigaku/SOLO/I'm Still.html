Silhouettes of gray above the road I walk today
When was the last time I saw the reflection of my face?
It's easy just to say that everything will be okay
But is that the answer that's really deep inside my heart?

It's not always going to be a sunny day, I know
But if I try I might just get a glimpse

I'm still dreaming
Can't hide this feeling
I want to see a world that I have never seen before
Sunlight beaming
I'll go freewheeling up high
雲を切り裂いて
空高くへ fly free
心描く景色　私だけの道
No one can stop me from being who I am
I'm still dreaming

言葉では簡単に言えることも
本当はとても難しいけど
もう二度と嘘はつきたくないの
心に決めた答えだから

Life's not always going to be all fun and games, I know
But through the pain, I'll learn to love again

I'm still breathing
My heart keeps beating
Cause I believe that there's so much that I have yet to see
There's a meaning
To everything in our lives
信じてみようよ　自分のことを
Oh

誰かが決めた　シナリオ通りじゃ
私の声は　届かない
響かせ melody
あの大空に
Now's the time to spread my wings and fly

I'm still dreaming

I'm still dreaming
Can't hide this feeling
I want to see a world that I have never seen before

I'm still breathing
My heart keeps beating
Cause I believe that there's so much that I have yet to see
Sunlight beaming
I'll go freewheeling up high
雲を切り裂いて
空高くへ fly free
心描く景色　私だけの道
No one can stop me from being who I am
I'm still dreaming

Kumo o kiri saite
